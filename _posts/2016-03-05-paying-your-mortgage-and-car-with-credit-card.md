I am steering away from my usual posts that are technical in nature to share with you guys a credit card strategy that I have been researching and putting together to maximize the rewards on my monthly expenditures. I will probably repurpose the blog to talk about different things that pique my interest and I will probably create a new theme to reflect the different interests.

Lately I have been getting into the credit card game, by this I mean paying absolutely everything I possibly can with a credit card to generate rewards (travel miles, cashback, etc). I use to do this to a certain extent but I I have derived a strategy that allows me to indirectly pay for the bills that I would typically not be able to pay with a credit card. Some examples are mortgage and car payment. The lenders do not allow you to put in your credit card number to make these purchases, they make you enter your bank account number so they can do an [ACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House) transaction from your financial institution. I don't like this, so I decided to do some research and do something about it.

I introduce you to Amex Bluebird!

Amex Bluebird is a checking account/debit alternative that has a bill pay feature which is the pillar of this strategy.

**Putting money into Amex Bluebird**

So now that you have a Bluebird account, the next logical question becomes, how can I put money into Bluebird to pay my mortgage and car? Well, I am glad you asked. The way I have been loading Bluebird is through Visa Gift Cards. I buy Visa Gift Cards in the $500 denomination, anywhere from a $3.95 to $6 fee. I also buy PayPal My Cash load cards to load my PayPal account and then load BlueBird. I play with it. Bluebird has a monthly load limit of $5000 and a daily load limit of $2500. Paypal has a montly load limit of $4000 and a daily load limit of $500.

The method to load Bluebird is going to cost you a little bit of money but with the rewards that you get back it should offset the cost and you should come out ahead.

**A little example**

For example if I buy $1000 worth of gift cards that should run me at about $4.95 * 2 = $9.90 - that is less than 1% in fees, but if you are buying it at a gas station where your card gives you 3x for all gas station purchases then the rewards you actually get are 3029.7 points which can be redeemed at 1%. In pure cashback you are coming out $20 ahead. This is equal to $30.30 in cashback but a lot more if you redeem it for travel which would be my recommendation. NEVER EVER redeem for electronics or gift cards, your redemption value is so low it makes me want to cry. Also, if you have a card that gives you more than one point per dollar at grocery stores you definitely come out ahead, find the card that gives you more than 1x at certain places and see if they sell gift cards there.

**Paying the mortgage and car payment**

Through Bluebird you can add Payees in which I have added my mortgage and car lender. Bluebird already has a lot of preset payees in their system so for common lenders they have everything address and name ready for you, all you have to do is search for them. Look up your lender on google and then append "Pay by Mail" to see their instructions on how to send the payment by mail. March 2016 is the first month where I have cancelled all my automatic payments so once the payments post I will report back with a success story. :)

**Summary**

If you have been looking at paying your bigger bills through a credit card but your lender does not have an option for it, Bluebird is the answer! American Express has created a very easy to use interface and product to allow you to do this.
