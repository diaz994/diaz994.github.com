	Work History
</p>

I started getting into programming after landing a job at Wells Fargo a little bit after High School. I did some operation analysis for them and wrote VBA code inside of Excel to perform these tasks. My junior year of college I joined Santander Consumer USA as an Intern in their Software Architecture group, after the internship was over, I joined them on a part-time basis until graduation. Now I am in my current position at Pariveda Solutions.
